# ESO207--Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This repo contains all the assignments that I completed (in a group of 2) in a 4-month university course of Data Structures and Algorithms during my sophomore year at IIT Kanpur.

The problem statement of the assignments in brief (entire problem statement can be found inside each folder):

## 1. Calculating Fibonacci Numbers
The task was to implement the recursive, iterative and matrix exponentiation and analyze the time taken by the algorithm for increasing values of n. We compared the values of the time taken vs the the expected big-O time complexity of each algorithm to verify the word RAM model of computation.

## 2. Sparce Matrices
This assignment required us to come up with a compact representation of a sparce matrix and to design an efficient algorithm for their multiplication using this representation.

## 3. Expression Evaluation and a Stack
The first task was to implement a stack and the second task was to implement the O(n) algorithm (with a single pass of the string) to evaluate an expression given a certain precendence and associativity.

## 4. Implementing Nearly-Balanced Binary Search Trees
To implement a nearly-balanced binary search tree for efficient searching time (O(logn)) and to experimentally analyze its efficiency.

## 5. Quick Sort v/s Merge Sort v/s Modified Merge Sort
To compare the average case complexity of quick sort and merge sort.
Since quick sort outperforms merge sort, we were tasked with improving merge sort by "removing redundant overheads" and to compare the average running time of this improved algorithm with quick sort.
